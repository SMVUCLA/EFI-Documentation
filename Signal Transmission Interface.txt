Signal Transmission Interface
	At least 1 byte sent over Serial
	First byte is signal identifiers
		This should be a 1 byte number (0 to 255)
	All further bytes should be reserved for value transmission
	Signal IDs (as of now):
		0: Arduino Reset
		1: Start Sending Data
		2: Stop Sending Data
		3: Synchronize Parameter Order
		4: Update Arduino's AFR Table
			See below for info on sending AFR table back and forth
		5: Update DAQ's AFR Table
			See below for info on sending AFR table back and forth
		6: Set Idle Fuel Ratio
			Sends 4 byte floating point number for IFR
		7: Set Current Fuel Ratio
			Sends 4 byte floating point number for CFR
		8: Set Reset Fuel Ratio
			Sends 4 byte floating point number for RFR
		9: Set Desired RPM
			Sends 4 byte integer for dRPM
		10: Set Desired O2
			Sends 4 byte floating point number for dO2
		
	Order of Parameters Sent Over Serial
		44 bytes
		All Values are 4 bytes long

		front padding = 0x80000001
		time (unsigned long)
		totalRevolutions (unsigned long)
		ECT (float)
		IAT (float)
		MAP (float)
		TPS (float)
		OIN (float)
		totalPulseTime (float)
		RPM (signed long)
		back padding = 0x80000000

	Sending/Receiving AFR Table
		First byte is ID (4 or 5) for sending or receiving
		Second byte is for number of rows (0 to 255)
			Currently 10 rows
		Third byte is for number of columns (0 to 255)
			Currently 36 columns
		Each subsequent 4 bytes will be the value for the given table slot
			This means that the first set of 4 bytes will refer to table position (0,0), the second set of 4 bytes will refer to table position (0,1), and so on.
			Once the first row is filled up, the values start to refer to the second row.
